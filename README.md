- 👋 Hi, I’m @blatchard
- 👀 I’m interested in Qubes! Network-administration, wireless technology, cyber-security, white-hat, bash, linux, bugs, vulnerablities, foss.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash mostly, a little python and security and always tinkering with something.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - being of any use with Qubes, scripts, anything useful/helpful.
- 📫 How to reach me - only through github.

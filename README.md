- 👋 Hi, I’m @blatchard
- 👀 I’m interested in Qubes! Network-administration, wireless technology, cyber-security, white-hat, bash, linux, foss.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash mostly, a little python and security and always tinkering with something (currently my newly modded bios)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - i am light years from the knowledge of many githubbers.  Maybe one day....
- 📫 How to reach me - only through github.
